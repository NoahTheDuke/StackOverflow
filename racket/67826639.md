# What's the difference between Racket's findf and for/first functions?

The difference is that `for/first` iterates like `for`, so you have the full power of the Racket's [`for`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/for.html?q=for%2Ffind#%28form._%28%28lib._racket%2Fprivate%2Fbase..rkt%29._for%29%29) syntax available:

```racket
> (for/first ([i '(1 2 3)]
              [j "abc"]
              #:when (odd? i)
              [k #(#t #f)])
    (list i j k))
'(1 #\a #t)
```

To achieve the same with `findf`, you'd have to generate the entire list up front:

```racket
> (findf (Î» (x) (odd? (first x)))
         (for/list ([i '(1 2 3)]
                    [j "abc"]
                    [k #(#t #f)])
           (list i j k)))
'(1 #\a #t)
```

For searching a single list, you're correct that using `findf` is probably the correct function. It's simple and does what you need. But if you want to search across a more complex list or a list you need to create inline, `for/first` is better.
