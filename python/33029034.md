# Why aren't my input getting appended into the array? (Python)

You're passing an empty string (`guess = ''`) to `guess_function`, without assigning the returned value from `guess_function` to a variable. Then you're appending to your array the empty string, `guess`, instead a variable holding the returned value from `guess_function`, which is why your array is filled with `''`.

I've added comments to a cleaned up working version of your code, describing my choices.

```python
# Initializing a "guess" variable in global scope is unnecessary, because it's unused.
array = []

# This function doesn't need any arguments, because it handles all logic inside.
def guess_function():
    guess = input("Enter a letter:  ")
    guess = guess.upper()
    while ord(guess) < 64 or ord(guess) > 90:
        print("Invalid input, please try again..")
        guess = input("Enter a letter: ")
        guess = guess.upper()
    return guess

def populate_array(array):
    while len(array) < 26:
        # Call the function and assign to a variable the result.
        guess = guess_function()
        array.append(guess)
        # Because of the while loop, no need to recursively call the self-same function.
        # Instead of printing the array each time, return the array.
        # This way, the calling function can determine how to display the array.
    return array


print(populate_array(array))
```
