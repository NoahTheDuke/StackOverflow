# What does if-if-else one-line do in Python? [duplicate]

You have found the [ternary operator](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/394809/does-python-have-a-ternary-conditional-operator), which is known as a [Conditional Expression](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0308/) in Python. The expression `x if condition else y` means that if the condition (which can be a complex statement or function) evaluates to True, the expression returns `x`, and if the condition evaluates to False, the expression returns `y`.

It works like the following if-statement:

    if test1:
        if test2:
            print(x)
        else:
            print(y)

Your error stems from not wrapping the [print function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) arguments in a parentheses. This is a change made to Python 3, whereas in Python 2, your syntax would have been fine. Rewrite it to look like:

`if test1: print(x if test2 else y)`

and your error will go away.
