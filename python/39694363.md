# Deleting values from multiple arrays that have a particular value

A slow method involves operating over the whole list twice, first to build an intermediate list of indices to delete, and then second to delete all of the values at those indices:

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1,2,3,0,4,5,0])
b = np.array([1,2,3,4,0,5,6])

arrays = [a, b]
vals = []

for array in arrays:
    ix = np.where(array == 0)
    vals.extend([y for x in ix for y in x.tolist()])

vals = list(set(vals))

new_array = []
for array in arrays:
    new_array.append(np.delete(array, vals))
```
